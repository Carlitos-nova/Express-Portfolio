      Hello, my name is Carlitos de Castro, and I am currently completing my Software Engineering Technician diploma at 
      Centennial College. My reason of interest in pursuing a job opportunity in my field, is that I am very interested in the support 
      in growth of my career development with having industry training and creating a strong peer network with my fellow coworkers. 
      I am confident I would make a strong addition to any company. My history of learning how to code started when I was 13 years old 
      when I started to use a website called Scratch as a fun coding game to play as my free time. Then I improved on my coding skills 
      during my high school years as I started to do Microsoft C, JavaScript, and Adobe Actionscript. My critical thinking and 
      problem-solving skills make me uniquely qualified and useful candidate for your department. In fact, I was recommended from a 
      friend to work for him as an IT Assistant during my previous job, and from then on, I was quickly task to create an inventory 
      application. That opportunity gave me knowledge and experience, as well as learning how to handle difficult situations in a 
      working environment. So, thank you for your time and consideration learning about me.
